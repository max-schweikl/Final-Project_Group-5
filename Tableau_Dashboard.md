# Tableau Story: Movie Genres

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to allow for visualizations in trends of movie genres. Specificially, the goal was to see if the rise of streaming services impacted which movies saw box office success.

A rough idea for the dashboard was sketched out here: [Dashboard Layout](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ppohUS7lz0ywqLALRNWI7Y0NSrHBQvtAunWuu660ZdE/edit#slide=id.p)

## Results
An interactive dashboard was created to allow the user to filter by genre and see:
- Total Revenue
- Top Movies by Revenue and by Rating
- Average Revenue and Rating
- The number of successful vs. failed movies (success being defined as a movie making twice its budget in revenue)
- A visualization of the revenue for the genere by year

The dashboard can be seeen here: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bailey.van.ommeren/viz/FinalProjectDashboard_16535275197320/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

## Summary
Overall, it appears that while all movies have gone up in revenue, genres such as Romance have seen modest declines, potentially because they can be enjoyed at home.
