# Machine Learning Plan

## The y value
We will be using the sucessful field as the y value for this machine learning. The successful field is a calculated field where 1 = successful and 0 = not successful. Success is determine by if the gross revenue is double the cost of production then that movie is successful. 

## The features
The planned features that we will be using are
- actor
- director
- writer
- production studio
- genre
- tmdb rating
- imdb rating

## The machine learning model
This is considered a supervised machine learning model as we know the y value for the data. This is a classification type model as we are trying to predict a yes or no. Our initial plan is to use a regression machine learning model to help us understand which features are strongly connected to a movie's success.
