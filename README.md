Final-Project_Group-5 Main repository for UofM Data Visualization &amp;amp; Analytics Boot Camp Final Project (Group 5), hosted by Max Schweikl, Stephanie Leonard, Randy Sendek, Lucas Bratland and Bailey Van Ommeren

## Project Topic
Our team would like to determine what a future movie release will earn for revenue at the box office based on a variety of input factors that go in to the production, including but not limited to the movie cast, crew, posteres production companies, release date, and so on.

## Dataset Chosen
We will be utilizing a Kaggle .csv dataset that provides ~7400 movies and a variety of different movie attributes, some of which were called out in the project topic headline above.

## Tools to Clean Data
Python and Pandas will be utilized to clean our dataset throughout the length of this project.

## Chosen Database
Currently our group is leaning towards utilizing a SQL/PostGres database with the raw data contents being extracted as a .csv file.

## Chosen Machine Learning Model
Our team is currently considering utilizing matplotlib to visualize trend of gross movie income and rating over time.  We would like to use a regression ML model to understand which movie production factors lead to the highest box office success, as well as which attributes are either not correlated/connected.
