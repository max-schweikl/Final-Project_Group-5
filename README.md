Final-Project_Group-5 Main repository for UofM Data Visualization &amp;amp; Analytics Boot Camp Final Project (Group 5), hosted by Max Schweikl, Stephanie Leonard, Randy Sendek, Lucas Bratland and Bailey Van Ommeren

## Project Topic
Our team would like to determine what a future movie release will earn for revenue at the box office based on a variety of input factors that go in to the production, including but not limited to the director, movie cast, crew, posters/marketing, production companies, release date, and so on.  This will be a classification question to answer, in that "success" will be defined as if the movie doubled it's production spend in generated revenue results.

## Dataset Chosen
At the moment, we will be utilizing a .csv dataset provided by the University of Minnesota that provides +$25M movie entries and a variety of different movie attributes, some of which were called out in the project topic headline above.  If this dataset is too large/overvalued, we will transition to an alternative option.

## Tools to Clean Data
Python and Pandas will be utilized to clean our dataset throughout the length of this project.

## Chosen Database
Currently our group is leaning towards utilizing a SQL/PostGres database with the raw data contents being extracted as a .csv file.

## Chosen Machine Learning Model
Our team is currently considering utilizing matplotlib for our visualizations on this project, comparing various movie input components against their resulting revenue that was generated.  We would like to use a regression ML model to understand which movie production factors lead to the highest box office success, as well as which attributes are either not correlated/connected.  Being this is a categorization question, it may also be worth exploring if a decision tree model also makes the most sense for our analyis here.
